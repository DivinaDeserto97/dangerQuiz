# Danger Quiz

1. PROJECT TITLE: Trivia Quiz+ 

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: In a previous "novice" project ("Trivia Quiz"), each of us developped individually a simple Trivia Quiz, using PHP and a MySQL database. In this follow-on group project ("Trivia Quiz+"), we extended the functionality and groomed the visual appearance of the first version of the Trivia Quiz.

3. USAGE: The first page (index) introduces the Trivia Quiz and allows to select a topic, the number of questions to be asked, and the time available per question. The second page (question) displays the multiple-choice and multiple-answer questions, and a countdown timer indicating the time remaining to answer the question. The third page (report) shows the number of correct questions out of the number of total questions, whereas the feeedback is animated (visual, sound, text, 30-60-80-95%-thresholds). All layout text including theme titles, mood backgrounds, icons and illustrations are called from the database. 

4. TECHNOLOGIES: The following programming languages, frameworks, and libraries were used to build the project: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, PHP, PDO, MySQL, phpMyAdmin.

5. CONTRIBUTORS: Cyrill (mobile UI of index question and report pages); Samir (single- and multiple-choice questions, separate tables); Chris (animated feedback on report page with visual, sound, text, 30-60-80-95%-thresholds); Tobias (text, titles and illustrations all from database); Mayckell (support for other team members where required). 

6. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS: At the beginning of the project, we agreed on goals and the distribution of tasks. The Github infrastructure was then set up by Tobias, who continued to be responsible for Github during the project. Next, Cyrill set up the Trello board. Since we sat at the same table throughout development, the need for project coordination via Trello remained rudimentary. In addition, the mockups for the three pages were developed together under the direction of Tobias, one set each for design, function and interfaces. Based on the templates, Cyrill created an HTML layout and applied it to the three pages. At the same time Tobias wrote the PHP and Samir updated the database with the multiple choice multiple answers. Then all the parts were put together. Finally, Chris and Tobias revised the database in terms of images and the mechanism to access them. Throughout the project, Mayckell played an important role in troubleshooting, debugging, and helping other members who needed support. We worked very well together as a team. On downside, there was no time left to finalize the dark-light mode toggle.
